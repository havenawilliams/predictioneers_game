This is Gambit, an Open Source software project dedicated to developing and
providing tools and methods for computation in game theory.

Contacting Gambit:
------------------

The Gambit developers can be reached at ted.turocy (at) uea.ac.uk

Other sources of code in this distribution:
-------------------------------------------

Gambit incorporates portions of other software packages in this distribution.
These are acknowledged individually below.

Integer/Rational classes:
-------------------------
The files integer.(cc,h), rational.(cc,h), and gnulib.(cc,h) in
sources/base are from an old GNU g++ library, with copyright statement:

Copyright (C) 1988 Free Software Foundation
    written by Doug Lea (dl@rocky.oswego.edu)

These files have been modified only to work as appropriate with other
Gambit classes.

Function minimization code:
---------------------------
The files gfuncmin.(cc,h) in sources/numerical contain source code derived
from the GNU Scientific Library, version 1.2.  The original files have
the copyright statement:

Copyright (C) 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 Fabrice Rossi

These files have been modified only to port them from C to C++ and
to use the gFunction class.

Clique determination:
---------------------
The gambit-nfg-enummixed program incorporates the code of
Bernhard von Stengel to determine the connectedness of components of
Nash equilibria.  (BvS has also contributed numerous other improvements
and fixes to other areas of Gambit.)

Gametracer:
-----------
The global Newton and iterated polymatrix implementations are based on
those in Gametracer 0.2, copyright (C) 2002 by Ben Blum and
Christian Shelton, distributed under the GPL.  See the directory
sources/tools/gt in the distribution.

wxSheet classes:
----------------
The graphical interface makes significant use of the wxSheet classes for
wxWidgets, which are Copyright (C) 2004-5 by John Labenski, and distributed
under the wxWidgets license.  The version included here is the version
dated 20 July 2005; see http://wxcode.sourceforge.net for details on these
classes.

TinyXML parser:
---------------
The graphical interface reads and writes files in XML format.  The parsing
is done using the TinyXml package from http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml,
and is distributed under the zlib license.  These are the files named
tiny* in the sources/gui directory of the distribution.
