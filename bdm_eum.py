        - It seems to me that BDM's intent was that in order to calculate

          across different policy positions that the actor could hold. Instead,
          Scholz compares the actor's danger level to the danger level of all
          other actors. This comparison doesn't seem relevant, given that other
          actors will have danger levels not possible for the given actor
          because of differences in salience and capability.
        - Even (what I assume to be) BDM's original intention is an odd way to
          calculate risk acceptance, given that the actor's policy position may
          have been coerced, rather than having been chosen by the actor based
          on its security preferences.
